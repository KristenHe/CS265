All these scripts work on the basis that the ARCHIVE variable is 
/home/kschmidt/public_html/CS265/Assignments/DrMath/Archive

Each script is capable of carrying out a specific task:
prob1 - Detemine the number of directories containing messages and the total number of messages sent.
prob2 - Detemine the longest thread from all the threads and find any other threads of the same length.
prob3 - Given a set of three arguments that specify a date (in the order yyyy mm dd), this script will find all messages sent on that day.
prob4 - Find all distinct hostnames (case-insensitive) and the number of messages sent to each. Also calculates the total number of distict hostnames.

For prob2 I assumed that the thread length that is appended to the end of the file name would provide an accurate representation of how many messages were in the thread.

There is nothing extra required to run these scripts.
