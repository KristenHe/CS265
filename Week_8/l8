1)
	i) Implementation of a program must be hidden from the user so that they can be changed without affecting users.
	ii) Provide a set of non-overlapping functions and capabilities that do one thing well.
	iii) An interface must do only what it is supposed to do and not do anything that the user does not know about.
	iv) Programmers should implement similar interfaces/programs in a consistent way.

2) Empty fields, commas within quotes and escaped quotes are not properly handled.

3)	Commas within quotes are handled better, quotes within quotes are handled better.

4)	Empty fields are still not handled properly. You cannot parse two files at the same time as the file names have to be "redirected" to the program through stdin.

5)	No the C++ implementation does not solve these issues. The issue of empty fields not being handled properly is still visible.

6) Yes it does.
