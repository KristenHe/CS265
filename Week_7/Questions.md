Go to JavaRanch, click on the Cattle Drive, do assignments 1(a), 2, 3, and 8 . These will be the classes prob1, prob2, prob3, and prob4, respectively.

Create a build.xml (see the slides on ant) that has targets name as the classes, above, and run it (w/some appropriate command-line args to run your programs).
