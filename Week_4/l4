----- Programming Style -----

1.1) We already know that 0 means false and 1 means true 

1.2)
int IsSmaller(char *first, char *second) {
	if (strcmp(first, second) < 1)
		return 1;
	else
		return 0;
	}

1.3) I read it out loud and it makes no sense.

1.4) 
	a) if ( c != 'y' || c != 'Y')
			return;
	b) if (length > BUFSIZE)
			length = BUFSIZE;
	c) flag = !flag;

	d) 	quote = 0;
			if (strcmp(*line, '"') == 0)
				qoute = 1;

	e) bit = (val & 1) ? 1 : 0;

1.5) The order in which the read methods are called is unknown to us. Furthermore, the purpose of the code is unclear, due to the unclear naming throughout the program.

1.6) 2 3 

1.7) 
a) if (!stty(stdin) && !istty(stdout) && !istty(stderr))
	return 0;

b) return retval 

c) 	for (k=0; k<4; k++) {
			scanf("%lf", &dx);
			x += dx;
		}

1.8) 
for (int count=0; count<total; count++) {
	if (this.getName(count) == nametable.userName()) {
		return (true);
	}
}
			
1.9) 
There are no parentheses around the variable 'c'.
Since 'c' occurs multiple times throughout the macro, the macro will be executed multiple times.

1.10) 
#define METER_PER_FEET 0.3048
#define FEET_PER_METER 3.2084
#define FEET_PER_MILE 5280.0
#define KILOMETER_PER_MILE 1.609344
#define SQUARE_KM_PER_SQUARE_MILE 2.589988

1.11) 
The 1st comment states that a void functio returns a value. This is incorrect as a void function does not return any value.

The 2nd comment explains what the % operator is used for but does not mention the 'MAX' variable.

The 3rd comment states that a message is being printed out, but does not explain what the message would be about. 

The 4th comment is a duplicate of the 5th as they both detail the same thing. 

The 6th comment is a duplicate of the 5th.
